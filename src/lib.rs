//! Functions for performing arithmetic modulo the 61st Mersenne number.
//! Aimed at testing bignum implementations.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! 
//! The crate comes with a trait [`M61Reduction`] and a type [`M61`].
//! `M61` is an integer in which all arithmetic is performed the
//! 61st Mersenne number, `2^61 - 1`.
//!
//! ```
//! use m61_modulus::*;
//!
//! let x = M61::from(1u64 << 61);
//! let y = M61::from(1u64);
//!
//! assert_eq!(x, y);
//! ```
//! 
//! The trait `M61Reduction` is implemented for unsigned integer slices,
//! providing two functions for reducing the modulo `2^61 - 1`,
//! as if they were digits in a bignum implementation.
//! 
//! ```
//! use m61_modulus::*;
//!
//! let x = [1u16, 734u16, 24u16].reduce_m61();
//! let y = M61::from(1) + M61::from(734 << 16) + M61::from(24u64 << 32);
//! 
//! assert_eq!(x, y);
//! ```
//!
//! The functions are `reduce_m61`, which is single-threaded, and `reduce_m61_parallelized`,
//! which may spawn additional threads.
//!
//! This crate comes with two features:
//! * `nightly`, which enables support for additional nightly-only ISA extensions
//!   like AVX512. Disabled by default.
//! * `std`, which provides access to the `reduce_m61_parallelized` function,
//!   which requires the Rust standard library. If disabled, this crate will
//!   also work on `no-std` targets. Enabled by default.
//!
//! ## Background
//!
//! This crate is designed around verifying the results of bignum implementations
//! (like `num-bigint`) in a cheap manner. By repeating an operation
//! using modular arithmetic one can test the results without having to
//! resort to simpler, but slower implementations involving arbitrary-precision
//! arithmetic.
//!
//! Arithetic modulo the 61st Mersenne number is particulary suitable for this:
//! * It is a prime number, which means the results distribute well given random input.
//! * Its difference of one to the next power of two makes calcuations incredibly cheap.
